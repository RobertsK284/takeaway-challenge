Takeaway Challenge
==================

This is an application to order takeaway.

To run it, type in 'ruby ./lib/takeaway.rb'

See the takeaway_feature_spec.rb for an example of the commands.

This one is not yet complete; the last user story is not yet completely functional.

I had some trouble with the tests for the checkout_method in user story 4, so I referred to Michael Slevin's solutiom here. https://github.com/MichaelSlevin/takeaway-challenge
